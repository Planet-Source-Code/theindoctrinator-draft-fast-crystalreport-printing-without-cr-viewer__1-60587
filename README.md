## Draft/Fast CrystalReport Printing without CR Viewer


</div>

### Description

Hi!!, This is my second submission:

Crystal Report Viewer For Draft Printing... (pure VB)

Since a long time, i was searching for Code Which provides me full control over viewing and printing thru Crystal Report. Such as count how many times users had printed the report, Stop the execution of report at any given time thru VB Code, Print CR Report in Draft Mode or Fast Printing Mode, etc...

I found some related code on the Net (in fact on this site only) but it was not satisfying my all needs, so i decided to dig more deep into the CR supported DLLs and OCXs and as the result i came up with some thing that am now introducing as :

"Crystal Report Viewer For Draft Printing"

This is at its very basic level (For those who had already bagged their heads against Crystal APIs) For others it may be a new door for understanding Crystal APIs.

Thru this Code the user can view Report in Draft mode that were Made in Crystal Report without using CRViewer or CrystalReport Control. This is totally dynamic and configurable. Benefits of this Code to View Reports are:

1.) No Additional Control needed to view report.

2.) Automatically Install Draft Printer if needed.

3.) Totally Dynamic. (eg: No need to worry about parameters, sql queries, Selection Formulas used in Report, the code will take care of that.

4.) Could Install custom printing Forms, if needed.

6.) Faster then original CR Controls.

7.) A little code is needed to Modify it according to your needs.

8.) A Line By Line Comment to make you understand what is happening in there.

8.) A Basic and Easy to Understand Module for Beginners

These Points are still Pending for the Next Version

1.) Printing Module to Print Same as in FOX-Base Systems. (Half-way completed)

2.) To Remove the Need of CRWrap32.dll and CRPE32.dll. (included with the Project)

[Note: If you can't find CrWrap32.d__ and CRPE32.d__ Files, Please DownLoad CRPE32.dll and CRWrap32.dll from the Net Before Continuing on this project, OtherWise Just Replace the _ Sign With l say.. rename the file with .dll extension]

This Project is still incomplete in many aspects and I would like to have an opportunity to call all developers those who are interested to complete this code. To do so, just leave a comment and mail me at VB2TheMAX@hotmail.com.

Please Do Not Forget to Vote....(do i need to say it again!!??)
